 * Seeds roles into the database if they don't already exist.

 * It first checks if any roles with the same names already exist in the database.
 * If any such roles exist, it throws an error to prevent duplicate role names.
 * If no such roles exist, it proceeds to create a new role record in the database for each role object in the roles array.
 *
 * @param {Payload} payload - The Payload instance to interact with the database.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the seeding process is complete.
